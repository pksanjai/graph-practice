# 📘 Graph Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my graph algorithms practice repository!  
This is where I document and track my learning journey through various graph-related problems and algorithms.

---

## 📌 Purpose

I'm currently learning **Graph Theory** and this repository contains my code implementations for different algorithms and problems. This helps me:

- Practice graph concepts
- Understand algorithm design and complexity
- Track my progress over time

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered (So Far)

- Graph Representation (Adjacency List, Matrix)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Prim’s Algorithm (for MST)
- Kruskal’s Algorithm (with Union-Find)
- Cycle Detection (Directed & Undirected)
- Connected Components
- Disconnected Graph Handling

---

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- Java (primary language for practice)
