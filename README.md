# graph-practice
This repository contains my practice codes and implementations as I begin learning graph algorithms. It includes solutions for basic and advanced graph problems such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim's, Kruskal's, and more. I'm using this space to track my progress and improve my understanding of graph theory and algorithm design.
